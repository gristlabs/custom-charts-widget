In the custom widget configuration, choose "Advanced Charts". If that's not available, choose “Custom URL” and paste the following URL:

https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/chart/

See the [documentation](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-custom/#advanced-charts) for information on using the widget and what it can do. The source code for that page is [here](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-help/blob/master/help/en/docs/widget-custom.md).
